## 🧮 Physics Behind the Magic

The simulation uses Newton's law of universal gravitation:

**F = G × (M × m) / r²** 📐

Where:
- ⚖️ **G** = Gravitational constant
- ⚫ **M** = Black hole mass
- 🔵 **m** = Particle mass
- 📏 **r** = Distance between centers

Plus **relativistic corrections** for nearby particles! ⏱️

## 📊 Example Output

The simulation generates:
- 🎥 **Real-time animations** of particle trajectories
- 📈 **Trajectory plots** showing orbital mechanics
- 💾 **Data files** with position/velocity information
- 📉 **Energy conservation** graphs
